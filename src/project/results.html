       <h2>Dry Skin</h2>
      <p>Your skin produces less natural oil and can often feel tight, rough, or flaky, especially in colder weather. The key is to restore and lock in moisture.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start your day with a gentle, creamy cleanser that won’t strip away hydration, followed by a toner or essence rich in hyaluronic acid or glycerin.</li>
        <li>Use a thick, nourishing moisturizer and finish with a hydrating sunscreen.</li>
        <li>At night, cleanse again softly, apply a hyaluronic-acid or niacinamide serum, and seal everything in with a richer cream or an overnight mask.</li>
        <li>A few drops of facial oil in winter can make a big difference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your lifestyle can also aid in making your skin better!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drink plenty of water, avoid long hot showers, and consider using a humidifier.</li>
        <li>Foods rich in healthy fats like salmon, avocado, and nuts help your skin from within.</li>
      </ul>

        oily: `
        <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
    <p>Your skin naturally produces more sebum, leading to shine and occasional breakouts. The goal is to balance oil without stripping the skin.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a foaming or gel-based cleanser to remove excess oil, followed by a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated without heaviness.</li>
      <li>Always wear sunscreen; many matte finishes work well for oily skin.</li>
      <li>At night, double-cleanse if you wear makeup and apply a serum containing niacinamide or salicylic acid to reduce oil buildup and minimize pores.</li>
      <li>Exfoliate 2–3 times a week with a gentle BHA to prevent clogged pores, and try to avoid touching your face throughout the day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management all help regulate oil production.</p>

        combo: `
        <h2>Combination Skin</h2>
    <p>Your skin behaves differently in different areas: oily on the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) and dry on the cheeks or jawline. The goal is to maintain balance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a gentle, low-foam cleanser that removes oil but doesn’t dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>Apply a light, hydrating moisturizer in the morning and use a richer cream only on dry areas at night.</li>
      <li>Layering different products for different zones can be very effective — for example, mattifying gel on the T-zone and a soothing cream on the cheeks.</li>
      <li>Once or twice a week, exfoliate gently to remove buildup and use clay masks on oily areas and hydrating masks elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Keep your routine flexible with the seasons — your skin may act more dry in winter and more oily in summer.</li>
    </ul>
