        <h2>Dry Skin</h2>
        <p>If most of your answers point to dry skin, your skin produces less natural oil and can often feel tight, rough, or flaky, especially in colder weather. The key is to restore and lock in moisture.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start your day with a gentle, creamy cleanser that won’t strip away hydration, followed by a toner or essence rich in hyaluronic acid or glycerin.</li>
          <li>Use a thick, nourishing moisturizer and finish with a hydrating sunscreen.</li>
          <li>At night, cleanse again softly, apply a hyaluronic-acid or niacinamide serum, and seal everything in with a richer cream or an overnight mask.</li>
          <li>A few drops of facial oil in winter can make a big difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your lifestyle can also aid in making your skin better!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drink plenty of water, avoid long hot showers, and consider using a humidifier.</li>
          <li>Foods rich in healthy fats like salmon, avocado, and nuts help your skin from within.</li>
        </ul>

      oily: `
        <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
        <p>If your answers lean toward oily skin, your skin naturally produces more sebum, leading to shine and occasional breakouts. The goal is to balance oil without stripping the skin.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a foaming or gel-based cleanser to remove excess oil, followed by a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated without heaviness.</li>
          <li>Always wear sunscreen; many matte finishes work well for oily skin.</li>
          <li>At night, double-cleanse if you wear makeup and apply a serum containing niacinamide or salicylic acid to reduce oil buildup and minimize pores.</li>
          <li>Exfoliate 2–3 times a week with a gentle BHA to prevent clogged pores, and try to avoid touching your face throughout the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management all help regulate oil production.</p>

      `,
      combo: `
        <h2>Combination Skin</h2>
        <p>If you selected mostly combination-type answers, your skin behaves differently in different areas: oily on the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) and dry on the cheeks or jawline. The goal is to maintain balance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a gentle, low-foam cleanser that removes oil but doesn’t dry out your skin.</li>
          <li>Apply a light, hydrating moisturizer in the morning and use a richer cream only on dry areas at night.</li>
          <li>Layering different products for different zones can be very effective — for example, mattifying gel on the T-zone and a soothing cream on the cheeks.</li>
          <li>Once or twice a week, exfoliate gently to remove buildup and use clay masks on oily areas and hydrating masks elsewhere.</li>
          <li>Keep your routine flexible with the seasons — your skin may act more dry in winter and more oily in summer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dry + Oily Skin</h2>
        <p>Your results show a mix of both dry and oily skin characteristics. This means your skin might feel tight or flaky in some areas but produce excess oil or shine in others. The key is balance and gentle care.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t over-dry your skin in an effort to reduce oil, and don’t overload it with heavy creams either.</li>
          <li>Try using a mild foaming or gel cleanser that removes oil without stripping moisture, then follow with a lightweight, hydrating moisturizer that contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid or ceramides.</li>
          <li>If certain areas are especially dry, you can add a richer cream just there.</li>
          <li>Use mattifying products only on oily zones (like the T-zone) and avoid alcohol-based toners.</li>
          <li>Consistent hydration will actually help your skin regulate oil production naturally.</li>
        </ul>

      "dry-combo": `
        <h2>Dry + Combination Skin</h2>
        <p>If your answers were split between dry and combination, your skin leans mostly dry but still shows some oiliness in specific areas, especially the T-zone. Focus on deep hydration while keeping balance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a creamy cleanser that nourishes dry spots and a lighter gel moisturizer for oilier areas.</li>
          <li>Layering works best — apply a hydrating toner or serum with hyaluronic acid all over, then seal with a richer moisturizer on the driest zones.</li>
          <li>Avoid over-exfoliating, as it can worsen dryness and stimulate more oil in other areas.</li>
          <li>Using a hydrating mask once or twice a week will help even out your texture and make your skin feel smoother overall.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Popular Picks:</strong> La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Cleanser, COSRX Hydrium Watery Toner, and CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for targeted areas.</p>

      "oily-combo": `
        <h2>Oily + Combination Skin</h2>
        <p>You have a blend of oily and combination skin, meaning your skin tends to produce more oil overall but not evenly across your face. Your T-zone may get shiny quickly while your cheeks or jawline remain normal. Stick to a simple, lightweight routine.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a foaming or gel cleanser to remove excess oil, followed by a toner with niacinamide or witch hazel to minimize pores.</li>
          <li>Apply an oil-free moisturizer — yes, even oily skin needs hydration — and finish with a matte sunscreen.</li>
          <li>A few times a week, use a clay mask or gentle exfoliant to keep pores clear.</li>
          <li>Focus your heavier treatments (like retinol or exfoliants) only where needed, not all over your face.</li>
